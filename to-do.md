# PatientApp

## To do List
Good amount of time invest to read the API docs and Find some of the issue in that
All of the code left with “ANY”:- want to make that as a Stricted Type to take an advantage of Type Script
Create custom validation Using reactive forms
Not handling errors at all
Error screen or promise not designed proper
Unable to check all the edge cases and because of that find some of the patient doesn't return with expected data
